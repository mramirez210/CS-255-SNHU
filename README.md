1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the DriverPass was Liam, the owner of the DriverPass system which allowed people to schedule driving lessons. The type of system that they wanted to implement was to move the process of scheduling to online and then offer packages; adding an extension to their already existing business model.

2. What did you do particularly well?
During the course of the projects, I think I have an understanding on reviewing the feedback and making considerations about what each step of the project may need. From there I was able to create the charts, track the scheduling, and improving on the UML diagrams to sell the ideas to the owner of DriverPass.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I was able to choose of the work, I think I would implement a better idea of how to gauge what the custoemr wanted out of the system and figure out different ways on how to improve upon the existing system.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By understanding the user's need, it should have been done during the initial interview and from there we can priortize the needs of the user because the system would only be best when it is usabile and able to satistfy most of the client's expectations of the system. Once the system is deployed, it should be able to cover the needs of the client.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When coming to designing the software, the approach that I had taken was looking at the different requirements on the timeframe and then working on smaller projects that contribute to the bigger project. For future projects, I woudl consider using more visualization tools to track the progress of the system's designs and analyzing the performance of each portion of the project.
